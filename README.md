# Retail Sales Insights 2023–24

## 📌 Project Scope

I took two years of sales records and turned them into clear takeaways the team can use right away. I focused on how sales changed over time, which customers bring in the most money, and which product groups keep the business moving.

### Mission

Every chart and number I put together helps answer three simple questions:

- Where are we seeing real growth?  
- Who is behind that momentum?  
- Which items deserve more room on the shelves?  

### Insight Commitment

Everything I built is meant to guide the next move:

- Marketing can spark new campaigns  
- Merchandising can shift stock where it matters  
- Finance can adjust forecasts with steady footing

## 🛠 Dataset & Toolkit

- **Source:** retail_sales_dataset.xlsx (about 60k transactions across 12 categories)  
- **Tools Used:** Excel 2021/365 — nothing extra, no coding  
- **Deliverables:** Five analysis sheets and one dashboard you can click through

## 🔧 Data Preparation

- **Clean Structure:** I turned the raw file into an Excel Table (`cleaned_data`) to keep everything organized.  
- **Smooth Updates:** PivotTables refresh together with one shortcut (`Ctrl+Alt+F5`).  
- **Easy to Trace:** One clean source makes reviews simple for finance and compliance.  
- **Age Groups:** I built a simple age split — Young (<30), Middle (30–55), Older (>55).  
- **Currency:** I cleaned up formats so numbers look consistent everywhere.

## 📊 Deep Dive Analyses

### Revenue by Category
- Electronics and Home Goods bring in over half of total revenue. I recommended keeping these stocked first.  
- The lowest four categories each make up under 5%, so I tested bundling to boost add-on sales.  
- Electronics earns the most but ranks low on margin, so I paired it with Accessories to lift profit through cross-selling.  

### Quarterly Sales Trajectory
- Q4 jumps every year, so I suggested stocking up by October to avoid holiday gaps.  
- Q2 2024 rose 18% compared to last year, helped by a Memorial Day influencer push.  
- Q3 2024 slipped, telling us it’s time for new promos.  
- **Forecast:** Q1 2025 is on track for $3.4M, about 9% higher than the year before.  

### Top Spenders & Segments
- The top 5% of customers bring in 28% of revenue, which supports building a loyalty program.  
- Middle-aged women spend 32% more than men in the same group.  
- Young men grew 22% year over year, making them strong targets for acquisition.  
- Category habits: Middle-aged women prefer Home Goods, while young men lean toward Electronics.

## 📈 Interactive Dashboard

- **KPI Cards:** Update on their own using `GETPIVOTDATA`.  
- **Bar Comparisons:** Show quarter-to-quarter changes like the 18% jump in Q2 2024.  
- **Trend Lines:** Spotted a slowdown in Electronics early, leading to a flash sale that brought a 5% lift.  
- **Age Rings:** Highlight that Middle-aged shoppers drive almost half of revenue.  
- **Slicers:** Let leaders filter by year or month without needing help.  


## 🚀 Next Steps

- **Inventory:** Boost orders for Electronics and Home Goods before Q4 rush hits.  
- **Marketing:** Reuse the Q2 influencer strategy for young men.  
- **Loyalty:** Build tiered rewards for high-spending middle-aged women.  



## 🎓 What I Learned

Working on this project helped me see how a pile of raw retail numbers can turn into something genuinely useful. Once the data was cleaned up and organized — one solid table, clear labels, and simple customer groups — the picture became much easier to read.

Along the way, I got better at:

- Noticing seasonal swings and changes in demand  
- Figuring out which customer groups have the biggest impact on revenue  
- Building Excel dashboards that anyone on the team can use without extra help  
- Turning insights into real suggestions for marketing, finance, and inventory  

It also pushed me to tell the story behind the numbers, taking thousands of transactions and turning them into guidance people can actually use.



## ✅ Conclusion

This analysis shows how much value sits in everyday sales data. Electronics and Home Goods bring in the most money, middle-aged shoppers keep growth steady, and the end of the year always brings a clear bump in sales.

By timing inventory better, focusing marketing on fast-growing groups, and rewarding top spenders, the business can grow without taking on new heavy costs.

Everything here — from the cleaned dataset to the dashboard — was built to help teams move quicker and make choices with confidence, backed by clear, simple evidence.
